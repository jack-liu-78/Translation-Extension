# About

This project is a simple Google chrome extension that can take the text a user highlights on a page and translate it to a desired language. I built this project to learn about how chrome extensions work, dabble in React, and also because of my recent hobby of learning Mandarin and Korean. 

## How to run
Simply clone down the repository, and then in chrome go to chrome://extensions/. Make sure developer mode is turned one and click "Load Unpacked". 
Select the build folder in this repo.
